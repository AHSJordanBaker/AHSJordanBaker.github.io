<p>Video games are a fantastic way to spend our free time, as they contain many pleasurable topics and escape reality. Video games are broken down into many factors, from gameplay, socializing, grinding, and exploration in an imaginary world that can take multiple forms. Games create a feeling of satisfaction when you spend a long time attempting to achieve something and then reward you for accomplishing the task. It can also vary in difficulty, transforming from easy-going and pleasant experiences to hellish and challenging tasks. The constant satisfaction from gaming creates an addiction, enticing the players to return for more and more each time they play.</p>
<p>The article <i>15 Reasons People Play Video Games</i> by Cam Adair successfully lists numerous reasons people play video games. The reasons entail the novelty of a game. The many options to play with friends, complete quests, make alliances, obtain all items, and more classify the game as a novelty.

Through immersive experiences, people can explore worlds, take risks without suffering consequences, and have complete control of their progress and outcome.

<h3> Game reviews on Minecraft: Are they reasonable? </h3>
<h2> Published Date: 8/14/2023		Sources: <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/minecraft/user-reviews/adult">Minecraft Game Reviews</a></h2>

<img src="C:\Users\baker\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2023-09-19 103026.png" alt="Kid Reviews">
<h2> Kid Reviews</h2>
<p> The kids' reviews convey that they enjoy the frequent updates, providing enough content to enjoy until the next update, keeping the game fresh. The reviews forgot to include the two versions of Minecraft, Bedrock and Java Edition, which provide two experiences that can make or break positive reviews. I prefer Bedrock edition because of the more accessible controls than Java, despite having less content. Overall, I agree with the reviews from parents and kids, forming a 5-star rating. The game is for all ages, has accessible controls, contains educational content, encourages creativity, and more. </p>
<img scr="C:\Users\baker\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2023-09-19 103015.png" alt="Parent Reviews">
<h2> Parent Reviews </h2>
<p> Looking at the overall reviews, I fully agree with the 5-star rating of Minecraft. It is a fantastic game, especially with the sandbox gameplay allowing limitless possibilities. Looking at the adult reviews, parents say it’s a beautiful game that endorses creativity, adventure, and problem-solving. Even the parents with first-hand experience at playing Minecraft said they enjoyed playing online with others in the fun minigames. Most parental reviews say it is family-friendly, but their only concern is the topics discussed on online servers, which I agree with. Kids are also fond of the educational benefits, the easy-to-play controls, and the messages it can teach. They know online play's dangers and how to use in-game safety features such as disabling chat and blocking people. </p>
<h3> My dream gaming PC </h3>
<h2> Published Date: 8/16/2023 </h2>
<p>If I were to have a dream computer, it would be a custom-built desktop computer. I prioritize gaming over work, looking for the best performance and graphics. For the CPU, I would use the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D processor. For cooling, I would implement multiple water-cooling tubes with custom RGB lighting for design. For RAM, I would utilize the DDR4-4000MHz CL20 for a maximum of 128 RAM. I would like a maximum of 10-20TB of storage for my numerous games. I’ll use the MSI MAG Z790 Tomahawk WiFi for the main motherboard, and the best optimal GPU would be the GeForce RTX 4090.</p>
<h3> FPS Shooters: what makes or breaks a game? </h3>
<h2> Published Date: 8/18/2023		Sources: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pixel-Gun-3D-Pocket-multiplayer/dp/B00I6IKSZ0#">Pixel Gun 3D</a> & <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=712832898">Team Fortress 2</a></h2>

<h2> Team Fortress 2</h2>
<p>The factors that make a good game are content, replayability, frequent updates, balances, and free-to-play ability. FPS games come in various quality ranges, including the Call Of Duty franchise, Battlefield Franchise, Team Fortress, Overwatch, Valorant, and more. Some of the best games in the FPS genre are Call of Duty Cold War, Battlefield 1, and TF2. These games have hours of content to give players a massively multiplayer experience. During their prime, these games would receive frequent updates, fixing potential bugs and creating balances for fair gameplay. There are also no pay-to-win features, meaning the victor will only win based on skill. </p>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81mD3-AlcCL.png" alt="Pixel Gun 3D">
<h2>Pixel Gun 3D</h2>
<p>One of the worst games in this genre is Pixel Gun 3D. It was a humble, free mobile FPS game that allowed anybody to play. Eventually, the game turned for the worse, adding guns locked behind paywalls or weeks of playing for a single weapon, which could be easily purchased for a measly few bucks. They wouldn’t change this implementation and continued adding imbalance weapons, which took the skill out of the game. As a result, the game tragically died and lost most of its player base.</p>
<h3> Toxicity: How to battle toxic players </h3>
<h2> Published Date: 9/12/2023		Sources: <a href="https://www.esports.net/news/tackling-toxic-gaming-behavior/">Esports: Toxic Players</a> & <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/toxicity-in-gaming-is-dangerous-heres-how-to-stand-up-to-it/">Combating Toxicity</a></h2>
<img src="https://www.esports.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Tackling-Toxic-Gaming-e1590156726992.jpg" alt="Rage">
<p>Toxicity in gaming is when players are rude and disrespectful to others by various means. Being toxic can be insulting others, making racial or rude remarks, teasing players who aren’t as skillful, and more. It’s essential to recognize toxicity since it can be a form of cyberbullying, depending on the severity, impacting victims' emotions. Those malicious remarks and behaviors can impact one’s self-esteem, make them angry, and ruin the fun of playing. A way to combat toxicity is to let the person know they are being toxic. Informing them can have two outcomes: the player can apologize and move on or become increasingly offensive. You can also report them for their behavior to the moderation, block, and mute them.</p>
<h3> Faze Clan: A powerful esports team </h3>
<h2> Published Date: 9/19/2023		Sources: <a href="https://fazeclan.com/about/">Faze Clan: About Page</a> & <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/66287425743197395/">Faze Clan Logo</a></h2>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/2d/e0/d7/2de0d7dfb11aaec3ec826d7e56d80426.jpg" alt="Faze clan logo">
<p>The Faze Clan is an esports group that competes in many genres in games and tournaments worldwide. They are known for being the best-of-the-best, recruiting only the most skillful players to join the clan. What makes the clan so successful is how they cooperate. The members work together and train for any upcoming events. Going from kids with cameras to elite players winning big prizes, the members have worked their way up to prove their skills. They also interact with their fans, having over 500M followers across social media platforms. They only need to work on staying out of controversial topics, which can taint their reputation.</p>
<h3>Haptic Suits: The future of esports</h3>
<h2> Published Date: 10/16/2023      Sources: <a href="https://teslasuit.io/products/teslasuit-4/">Teslasuit: Haptic Suit</a></h2>
<img src="https://teslasuit.io/wp-content/themes/teslasuit-portal/assets/img/animation/product-startscreen-suit-4.webp" alt="Teslasuit">
<p>The haptic suit is the pinnacle of gaming technology, creating muscle and sensory stimulation when playing video games. For a high price of $13k, one can purchase a haptic Teslasuit to enhance the gaming experience. The Teslasuit uses electric currents to stimulate muscles and nerves, covering many haptic senses. The haptic suit not only stimulates but also tracks motion. The Teslasuit can be used for motion capture, contributing to computer-generated images and animation development. It can track your current position and record movements. The suit can also analyze the user’s biometric information, tasked with understanding oxygen levels, BPM, pulse, and other physical statuses.</p>
<img src="https://teslasuit.io/wp-content/themes/teslasuit-portal/assets/img/schemes/haptic-feedback-scheme.webp" alt="Haptic Feedback">
<p>I am excited for the future of haptic suits because of their multi-purposes. The suit can be used in the medical field to understand users' physical conditions, it can be used for gaming or movie development, or it can be used for enhancing gaming experiences for esports users. It would be incredibly interesting to host an FPS or a battle royal tournament and witness how the competitors react to being hurt while keeping their cool. If gamers were provided with these suits without the pricy costs, the suit could gain popularity quickly. Massive streamers can advertise the product as well to improve sales amongst viewers. </p>

<p>People create products, images, recordings, and various forms of literature and want to claim and protect their property from theft. The purpose of copyright is to protect a person's intellectual property from being claimed by another person, copied, and monetized by another person without permission. For example, The Coca-Cola Company puts a copyright on their drinks and recipes, preventing people from stealing and profiting from those drinks. Creative Commons is similar to copyright because it allows a creator to claim their work, but the creation is allowed for use instead of preventing it. The details for usage may have different restrictions per person, however, a person cannot claim a product under Creative Commons as their own or monetization. Both concepts possess a punishment for breaking their rules, resulting in warnings, fines, legal trouble, or possible jail time.</p>
