<h3> Game reviews on Minecraft: Are they reasonable? </h3>
<h2> Published Date: 8/14/2023		Sources: <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/minecraft/user-reviews/adult">Minecraft Game Reviews</a></h2>

<img src="Images/Screenshot 2023-09-19 103026.png" alt="Kid Reviews">
<h2> Kid Reviews</h2>
<p> The kids' reviews convey that they enjoy the frequent updates, providing enough content to enjoy until the next update, keeping the game fresh. The reviews forgot to include the two versions of Minecraft, Bedrock and Java Edition, which provide two experiences that can make or break positive reviews. I prefer Bedrock edition because of the more accessible controls than Java, despite having less content. Overall, I agree with the reviews from parents and kids, forming a 5-star rating. The game is for all ages, has accessible controls, contains educational content, encourages creativity, and more. </p>

<h2> Parent Reviews </h2>
<p> Looking at the overall reviews, I fully agree with the 5-star rating of Minecraft. It is a fantastic game, especially with the sandbox gameplay allowing limitless possibilities. Looking at the adult reviews, parents say it’s a beautiful game that endorses creativity, adventure, and problem-solving. Even the parents with first-hand experience at playing Minecraft said they enjoyed playing online with others in the fun minigames. Most parental reviews say it is family-friendly, but their only concern is the topics discussed on online servers, which I agree with. Kids are also fond of the educational benefits, the easy-to-play controls, and the messages it can teach. They know online play's dangers and how to use in-game safety features such as disabling chat and blocking people. </p>
<h3> My dream gaming PC </h3>
<h2> Published Date: 8/16/2023 </h2>
<p>If I were to have a dream computer, it would be a custom-built desktop computer. I prioritize gaming over work, looking for the best performance and graphics. For the CPU, I would use the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D processor. For cooling, I would implement multiple water-cooling tubes with custom RGB lighting for design. For RAM, I would utilize the DDR4-4000MHz CL20 for a maximum of 128 RAM. I would like a maximum of 10-20TB of storage for the numerous games I’ll have. I’ll use the MSI MAG Z790 Tomahawk WiFi for the main motherboard, and the best optimal GPU would be the GeForce RTX 4090.</p>
<h3> FPS Shooters: what makes or breaks a game? </h3>
<h2> Published Date: 8/18/2023		Sources: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pixel-Gun-3D-Pocket-multiplayer/dp/B00I6IKSZ0#">Pixel Gun 3D</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=712832898">Team Fortress 2</a></h2>

<h2> Team Fortress 2</h2>
<p>The factors that make a good game are content, replayability, frequent updates, balances, and free-to-play ability. FPS games come in various quality ranges, including the Call Of Duty franchise, Battlefield Franchise, Team Fortress, Overwatch, Valorant, and more. Some of the best games in the FPS genre are Call of Duty Cold War, Battlefield 1, and TF2. These games have hours of content to give players a massively multiplayer experience. During their prime, these games would receive frequent updates, fixing potential bugs and creating balances for fair gameplay. There are also no pay-to-win features, meaning the victor will only win based on skill. </p>

<h2>Pixel Gun 3D</h2>
<p>One of the worst games in this genre is Pixel Gun 3D. It was a humble, free mobile FPS game that allowed anybody to play. Eventually, the game turned for the worse, adding guns locked behind paywalls or weeks of playing for a single weapon, which could be easily purchased for a measly few bucks. They wouldn’t change this implementation and continued adding imbalance weapons, which took the skill out of the game. As a result, the game tragically died and lost most of its player base.</p>
<h3> Toxicity: How to battle toxic players </h3>
<h2> Published Date: 9/12/2023		Sources: <a href="https://www.esports.net/news/tackling-toxic-gaming-behavior/">Esports: Toxic Players</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/toxicity-in-gaming-is-dangerous-heres-how-to-stand-up-to-it/">Combating Toxicity</a></h2>
<img src="https://www.esports.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Tackling-Toxic-Gaming-e1590156726992.jpg" alt="Rage">
<p>Toxicity in gaming is when players are rude and disrespectful to others by various means. Being toxic can be insulting others, making racial or rude remarks, teasing players who aren’t as skillful, and more. It’s essential to recognize toxicity since it can be a form of cyberbullying, depending on the severity, impacting victims' emotions. Those malicious remarks and behaviors can impact one’s self-esteem, make them angry, and ruin the fun of playing. A way to combat toxicity is to let the person know they are being toxic. Informing them can have two outcomes: the player can apologize and move on or become increasingly offensive. You can also report them for their behavior to the moderation, block, and mute them.</p>

<h3>Fresh Guides: Esports Coaching And Blogs For Beginners</h3>
<h2>Published Date: 10/3/2023</h2>
<img src="Images/Untitled (1).png" alt="Fresh Guides">
<p>For the flyer, I utilized the three design principles of hierarchy, color, and alignment. Demonstrating hierarchy, it was ordered as the title, headings, and paragraphs providing details. For color, I used a monochromatic color scheme of beige, creating a neutral and calm vibe that can attract an audience seeking a patient coach. I used the right alignment for alignment since I believe that if I were to use a combination of alignments, it would cause readers’ attention to bounce around until they lose interest. These three principles develop a sleek and straightforward flyer that attracts attention.
