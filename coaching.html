<h2>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</h2>
<p>Rated E for Everyone - <b>Amazing 9.3/10 Review</b> by Jose Otero of IGN </p>
<p>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for the Nintendo Switch is a fun racing game filled with customizable vehicles, loads of characters across the Nintendo franchise, and multiple games such as Grand Prix, Battle, and Time Trials. Grand Prix contains many maps that can be played in different rules such as 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, mirror, and 200cc. Battle has customizable rules where you are given three lives and tasked to attack other players. Time Trials test how fast you can complete three laps on any map. </p>
<h2> Easy Guide For Beginners </h2>

<p> Helped multiple people go from <i>noob</i> to <i>pro</i></p>
<p>This easy-to-follow guide for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is perfect for beginners to help understand the game and significantly improve over time by following these five tips: drifting, tricks, powerups, coins, and shortcuts. The five tips are essential because I have followed them and refined my skills to achieve first place consistently.</p>
<h3> How to play

<h1> 5 tips to use and improve on</h1>
<h2> Drifitng </h2>
<p>Drifting is the most crucial skill to have when playing Mario Kart. You can drift by holding ZR in either the left or right direction.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RqwSW6z4pK0yDEStigVrDlQf4U4=/0x0:1280x720/1200x800/filters:focal(538x258:742x462)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54510343/NintendoSwitch_MarioKart8Deluxe_Presentation2017_scrn08.0.jpg" alt="Clip 1" scr="Clip#1">
<p>When you drift, you can adjust the joystick and flick it to slowly adjust the speed and how far you go in the chosen direction. After reaching a particular spark color when drifting, let go for a little or powerful boost, depending on the tier. Drifting sparks are divided into three tiers: blue, orange, and purple. The longer you spend drifting, the color of the sparks will change. Drifting is easy to grasp but can become difficult on a more challenging map with incredibly tight turns and obstacles.</p>
<p>The benefit of drifting will result in the player moving faster, avoiding certain obstacles or attacks from players, and avoiding going off-road on curved roads. If used successfully, whether playing online or against CPUs, you create a massive gap between 1st and 2nd place.</p>
<h2>Tricks </h2>
<p> One of the most straightforward features in Mariokart 8 Deluxe is tricks. Tricks can be performed by clicking ZR the moment you jump/fly off a ramp or bounce on a surface. </p>
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*ba-ifHeK1TzUm5nXZ_3KcQ.jpeg" alt="Clip 2" scr="Clip#2">
<p>Doing a trick will result in a slight boost, which adds up over time, giving more speed. However, tricks cannot be performed at slow speeds.</p>
<p>Tricks are extremely easy to perform, but it can be tricky to time it, depending on the players trigger finger. Tricks such as the map <i>Bowsers Castle</i> and its rippling track section can also be difficult to notice.</p>
<h2>Powerups </h2>
<p>All powerups can be used to boost the player or attack other players. Powerups can be used by obtaining an item box and pressing ZL while shifting L3 up to use/throw it forward, and shifting L3 down will cause it to be thrown backward.  </p>
<img src="https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/mario_kart_8_deluxe_powerups_1493884911871.jpg" alt="Clip 3" scr="Clip#3">
<p>Powerups make up the competitiveness and joy in playing Mariokart 8 Deluxe. Powers give every player an equal opportunity to win, depending on how you use them. Some powerups are rarer than others and are more likely to or exclusively occur in farther places such as 10th, 11th, and 12th. The list of the powerups are:</p>
<p>Banana - Causes a player to slip and spin around if run over</p>
<p>Blooper - Reduces visibility and traction other than yourself</p>
<p>Bomb-omb - It makes an explosion and knocks players caught in a radius</p>
<p>Boo - Steals an item from all characters but yourself and makes you invincible</p>
<p>Boomerang Flower - Throws a boomerang in front of the player, knocking over an opponent hit by the boomerang</p>
<p>Bullet Bill - Turns a player into a powerful bullet bill, giving invincibility, autopilot, and a massive speed boost</p>
<p>Crazy Eight - A rare powerup that gives players 8 different items that spin around the player</p>
<p>Fire Flower - Shoots fireballs and knocks over players hit by them</p>
<p>Golden Mushroom - a temporary mushroom that allows the player to boost with the same mushroom infinitely until the time runs out</p>
<p>Green Shell - Throws a shell that ricochets off surfaces and can knock over players hit by them</p>
<p>Lightning - It shrinks all opponents and removes their powerups</p>
<p>Mushroom - Gives a single boost per use</p>
<p>Piranha Plant - A piranha plant attacks players in range and gives a boost for every attack landed</p>
<p>Red Shell - Similar to a green shell, but it locks onto the closest opponent</p>
<p>Spiny Shell - Creates a destructive path towards the 1st, knocking over anybody in its way, and once it reaches 1st, it creates an explosion, knocking over anybody in radius.</p>
<p>Star - Temporarily makes the player invincible to all powerups</p>
<p>Super Horn - It knocks over any players caught in its radius</p>

<h3> Coins
<p> Coins are both a strategy and a mechanic you should focus on. They are riddled across the map and can be collected through driving through them. </p>
<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MYDfyVJdzsI/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Clip 4" scr="Clip#4">
<p> Coins increase the player's max speed and add up to a significant amount. If an opponent hits a player or a player falls off the map (such as a cliff or clouds), they lose 3 coins and can not lose any more than 0. Coin capacity maxes out at 10 coins.</p>
<p>Coins should be your number-one priority to max out when starting a match since you will have more speed than your opponents. Avoid obstacles, do not fall off the track, and block your opponent's attacks with powerups by holding ZL to prevent losing your coins and momentum.</p></h3>
<h2> Shortcuts </h2>
<p>Shortcuts can be found within every map in hidden areas. </p>
<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9xA_6eeTsrM9MqyHc1xPJMyvk0k=/99x0:1179x720/1200x800/filters:focal(99x0:1179x720)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54697917/NintendoSwitch_MarioKart8Deluxe_Presentation2017_scrn30.0.0.jpg" alt="Clip 5" scr="Clip#5">
<p>The shortcuts make traveling through laps in faster time. However, it is challenging to do specific shortcuts because they require tight maneuvering use of momentum since some may be offroad or both.</p>
<p>Since completing shortcuts can be difficult, test them to see if it's worth the risk of losing your position or worsening it.</p>
